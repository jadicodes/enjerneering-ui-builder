# enJerneering UI Builder

## **Summary**

The **enJerneering UI Builder** is a web-based platform designed for freelance developers and professionals who create multiple websites for clients. It provides a **drag-and-drop interface** using a comprehensive set of reusable **React components** that maintain a consistent design system while allowing creative flexibility.

Projects created in the UI Builder can either be **previewed live** through a Supabase-connected Viewer or **published statically** via GitHub using a generated `data.json` file, enabling users to easily deploy websites without server management.

The enJerneering system is now composed of three linked repositories:
- **UI Builder** – Where users create projects.
- **UI Viewer** – For live database-driven previews.
- **UI Publisher** – For static, GitHub-hosted published sites.

All components and section types are shared across the system to maintain compatibility and styling consistency.

This platform is built to **speed up professional website production** without sacrificing customizability.
