## Topics Discussed

Jerrod used the iteration features added in Iteration 2. He cloned the WebInfoViewer repository, created a new project, inserted a header, footer, and textbox into the project
using drag-and-drop functionality. He then was able to save this web page and view it as a deployed web page. We then talked about testing
and using Vitest as a framework. He recommended, if Vitest seems to challenging with the way our project is set up, Playwright. He has
used Playwright before and said that you can navigate through the web pages and test them in a more interactive way. It may feel more
intuitive than Vitest.

## Things Clarified

Playwright MAY be a better testing framework for this project, but research is needed.

# Feedback
He then said that he felt like we had a good foundation built for the project and that it would not be a stretch to keep turning on features. He wants to see more thorough testing next iteration, and is willing to help clarify how to make that happen with the unique project structure.
