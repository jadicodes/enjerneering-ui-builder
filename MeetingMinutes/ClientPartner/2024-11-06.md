## Topics Discussed

- We demonstrated the iteration features with Jerrod. He had already seen the create a project features because we had run into environment errors that he helped solve. He had the database open in a separate tab and was able to
- observe the database updating in real time with created and deleted projects. Evan joined us for this meeting since he had been gone for the last several weeks in Italy. He proposed to his girlfriend while there! Evan was able
- to catch up with us and the project. He feels we are off to a good start and will continue to provide good work as long as we continue asking for help. Jerrod gave similar sentiments, and emphasized that we can always
- ask him for help if the backlog of code ever confuses us.

## Things Clarified

Jerrod is ALWAYS available and open to helping us when the code is confusing. He is especially accomodating since the project has so many files that were created before we joined the team.
