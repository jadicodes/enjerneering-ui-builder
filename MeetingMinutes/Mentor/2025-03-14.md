## Minute Recorder

Jadi

## Topics Discussed

- We showed Evan what we have completed so far (CSS fix so that built websites look normal, deploying using Vercel) and we pinned down exactly who will be doing what in these final days. He said that this iteration is shaping up to be promising, yet we still had a lot of work ahead of us.
- He suggested that we need to make the email function work more smoothly. Right now, it uses Mailto: which opens up the default mail app and is a bit clunky. Ideally, it would seamlessly send just in your browser.


## Things Clarified

Jadi:
- Will make the textbox so robust so that it is fully functional

Pierson:
- Will activate pages and NavBar

Jake:
- Add more tests

Payton:
- Add more tests
