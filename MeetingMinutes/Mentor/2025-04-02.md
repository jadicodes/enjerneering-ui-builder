## Topics Discussed

- I (Jadi) broke the news that I did not listen to Evan's advice to not live in downtown Indy. I recently put down the security deposit on my apartment in downtown Indy! He told me last time that he hated living in downtown, and I just didn't listen. But it's 7 minutes away from my job (WALKING DISTANCE!) so I'm really excited.
- We discussed the remaining iteration features, especially deployment. Jake asked Evan if he has any experience with GitHub API. He replied with... "kind of." We will mostly be figuring that out ourselves.
- Since we are near the end of our project, Evan focused a lot on post-graduation stuff. He announced to us that he would be a guest speaker at the CS banquet and wanted to emphasize post-grad living. We asked him some questions, especially about getting your first job and what it's like.
- We also demonstrated the software for him again so that he could see the state of things.


## Things Clarified

- Why he didn't like living in downtown Indy (noise, mostly)
- That he is a resource for us and will answer any questions we have about post-grad life
- That we should expect to see him at the CS banquet!
