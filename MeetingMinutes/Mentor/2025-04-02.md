## Topics Discussed

- I (Jadi) broke the news that I did not listen to Evan's advice to not live in downtown Indy. I recently put down the security deposit on my apartment in downtown Indy! He told me last time that he hated living in downtown, and I just didn't listen. But it's 7 minutes away from my job (WALKING DISTANCE!) so I'm really excited.


## Things Clarified

- How to possibly move forward with our database testing
- That our iteration 3 features sound reasonable, but to check-in with Jerrod to make sure they allign with what he wants
- That we can come to him for mock interviews! Cool!
