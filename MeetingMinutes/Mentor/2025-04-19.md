## Topics Discussed

- We started off by discussing the CS Banquet on Thursday. We got to meet Evan in person and listen to his awesome speech. It was a really cool experience and I'm glad he got to be there.
- We followed up by showing him the new features. The deployment had a LOT of kinks and took some on-the-fly problem solving to get working, but it worked well enough for Evan to give some feedback and advice on it.
- He asked again what he can do to help prepare us for lives after college. We've talked about this a lot with him, so we didn't have any new questions for him.


## Things Clarified

- Evan told us that we should lock in on focusing on deployment. Since that is such an important part of this iteration, it's important that we make it intuitive. Give the user some kind of idea how to use it and what they should do with the repository when they get it.
