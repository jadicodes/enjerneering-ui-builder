## Topics Discussed

We discussed the upcoming iteration. Evan did a review of our finalized design items, especially focusing on our iteration 1 tasks. Evan was able to look through the existing enJerneering codebase with us and give us tips on where to begin. Since Jerrod, our client, uses GitFlow for his team's workflow, Evan was able to show us a useful diagram so we know how to organize our flow. He also showed us a useful Typescript linter and formatter so that we as a team are all working with the same styleguide. As a team, we also found times that we can meet with our client for this iteration.

## Things Clarified

While our tasks for iteration 1 were all within a healthy scope, we rephrased and broke down our tasks so that they more accurately represent our workload for this iteration. This way, tasks can more easily be assigned per person. We will be assigning these tasks at our next team meeting.
