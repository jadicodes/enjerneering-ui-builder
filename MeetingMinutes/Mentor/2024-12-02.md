## Topics Discussed

- Advice on how to make a "recycling bin" database for our project. He suggested a seperate database table
- Advice on creating controllers to refactor web calls in Typescript
- His feedback - "Great iteration. Achieved many goals and is well-equipped for iteration 3."
- We should focus more on encapsulating our code, because the base we are working with is highly coupled. This makes it hard to test, as
all of the tests have to mock a bunch of different aspects of the projects and everything is interlinked.
- To refactor, make unit tests for calls, prove it works, then focus on thorough implementation.


## Things Clarified

- Typescript has OOP properties but is not really an OOP language.
- Testing in Typescript is clunky, do your best.
- Focus heavily on encapsulation next iteration.
