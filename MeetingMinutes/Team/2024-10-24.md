## Topics Discussed
Pierson before the meeting thoroughly studied the project's codebase and wrote up a report on where exactly the things we will edit are. This way, all four of us can easily dive in and handle our specific tasks.
Jadi and Pierson reviewed this together and started implementing the "Create New Project" functionality. After the meeting, the user is taken to a page where they can enter information, but that data is not yet stored anywhere.
There are fields to enter the information (the user can, for example, type in the Title for their project). Payton will be debriefing with us soon on how to connect the Next.js application to the database in Supabase. 

## Things Clarified
- The project file structure (THERE ARE A LOT OF EXISTING FILES)
