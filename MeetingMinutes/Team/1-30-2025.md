Jadi
## Topics Discussed
The three of us discussed our upcoming mentor meeting and what we would like to discuss with him. We discussed what tasks need to be done before the end of the iteration and who would be doing them. Jadi will be leading testing and ensuring
that the project reaches 70% test coverage. Pierson will be turning on more drag-and-drop and customization features. Jake will be working with WebInfoViewer, translating it into Typescript so that it can be updated with 
Tailwind features to clean up the look of saved websites. Payton will be helping Pierson turn on some customization features. Pierson will likely be writing the User manuals like he has the last 2 iterations.
