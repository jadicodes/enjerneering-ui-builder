Jadi
## Topics Discussed
The three of us shared a computer and mob programmed, trying to figure out how deployment of our project will work. We split up at times to do individual research. Jadi primarily focused on API research and how to connect the different end points relevant to EnJerneering. Pierson and Payton focused on Express and how to quickly implement an HTML page that can be deployed. We started a seperate repository outside of the EnJerneering one to test a bunch of different methods on and figure out how to best approach our problems. Payton's development environment had a defect, so we also spent some time improving our development process and document. 

## Things Clarified
Express will certainly be the best and fastest way for our web page to be functional.
