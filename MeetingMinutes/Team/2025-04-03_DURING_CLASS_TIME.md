## Things Clarified
Today we clarified who will be working on what for the rest of the iteration. We clarified which aspects of Evans feedback that we want to implement. We determined that while having an integrated mail sender would be nice, it is not nearly as important as the other aspects of this project.

## Progress Made
We put our effort today into making the other sections work. Since we've done it all before, activating the buttons and textboxes and customizable aspects, it's a good task to get ahead on now before we spend the rest of the iteration adding fully new things. Pierson shared his screen and Jadi pair programmed with him. Jake and Payton about halfway through separated off to continue researching and beginning our deployment pipeline. Giving the user access to their own website via a GitHub repository or JSON file will be a very important part of this iteration.

## Tasks Assigned
Jadi and Pierson will finish up turning on the rest of the sections. Pierson will specialize in the buttons and Jadi on the textbox, to mirror their tasks from last iteration. Jake and Payton will focus on implementing the deployment pipeline. When needed, Payton and Jake will also add new tests.
