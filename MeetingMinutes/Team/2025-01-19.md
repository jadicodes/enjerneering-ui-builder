## Topics Discussed
- The team discuessed what the next steps would be for the project. After our meeting with our mentor, we felt that we were in a good place to clear things up and split up potential tasks and workloads. 
- Discussed some ideas for how we could mix meeting our requirements for the project and providing a good product for our client in this iteration. 


## Things Clarified
- Jake and Pierson were able to clarify how the elements within pages are placed, and how those placed elements are stored within the database
