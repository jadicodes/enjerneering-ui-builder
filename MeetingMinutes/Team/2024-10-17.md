Jadi
## Topics Discussed
Jake is back from Japan! We had a brief discussion about what he learned and saw.

We recorded our most recent call with our client that goes over using the development environment. We are going to use this information and our exploratory 
research to write up our Development.md file. Jerrod has a very, very basic database foundation set up. We need to take 
that base and hook it up with the UI that also already exists. This will be implementing basic functions We split up responsibilities for this first part of iteration 1. We will reconvene early next week after we have
these first tasks done.
