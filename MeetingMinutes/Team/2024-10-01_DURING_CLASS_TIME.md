## Things Clarified
All of our various notes were collected from our client design meeting that took place the night before. We clarified exactly who would be fixing what.

## Progress Made
We updated our design documents with feedback from Jerrod, our client. Specifically, we updated our Tech Stack document to include Jerrod's specific reasoning for picking each piece of the stack, we updated our Domain Model to better 
fit Jerrod's already existing pieces of software, and we updated our functional requirements to be more specific and less vague.

## Tasks Assigned
Each person was assigned to create slides for the same design document they were in charge of making. Since Jake will be in Japan for the next 9 days, his tasks were split between Jadi and Pierson.
