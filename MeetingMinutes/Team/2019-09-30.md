## Topics Discussed
- For our first team meeting, we had assigned a different software that Jerrod uses in enJerneering to each of us to research and report back to the team. We shared what we learned about Prisma ORM, Postgres DB, Clerk Auth, App Router, and Supabase.
- We all spent time looking through the enJerneering UI builder codebase on GitHub. It was confusing, but important since our second client meeting would be the following day. We prepared questions for said meeting.
- Jake warned us that he will be leaving for a one and a half week visit to Japan on October 2nd. During that time, Jadi is the team leader.
- We are planning to schedule a Mentor Meeting on September 24th at 7pm and the Design Meeting with Jerrod on September 30th.

## Things Clarified
For next week, we will all prepare our questions for both the Mentor and Design Meeting. At next week's meeting, we will design a plan for the week Jake is gone to make sure the project stays on track during it's first iteration.
