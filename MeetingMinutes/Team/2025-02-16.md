## Topics Discussed
- The visual CSS issue in the WebInfoViewer
- How the NavBar might be able to work
- The Idea of transitioning WebInfoViewer into a vercel site, so it doesn't have to be ran every time 
- Jadi wants to work more on feature implimentation in future iterations
- Discussed with Jerrod about iteration 4 plan and iteration 3 feedback
  - Jerrod likes that there's been focus on data pushing, since that is the part that really matters to him
  - Jerrod thinks getting data pushed, and features working is most important, since he or his other team can work on the visual display issues


## Things Clarified
- Pierson showed Jake and Jadi some info on how the sections work and how their data is saved into the builderstore
- We gained a better understanding of how React is filling in the data fields within the component type files
- Worked with Jerrod on the WebInfoViewer, since he has the knowledge of the tech stack and tailwind
  - We determined that there were issues with how React and tailwind worked with the express framework of the app
  - Jerrod thought it would be best to transition WebInfoViewer to Next framework for tech stack alignment
    - Jerrod decided to do that, so our time can be used elsewhere, and it didn't take him long
  - Jerrod liked the idea of hosting WebInfoViewer
- Got database turned on (Jerrod said it was fine to unpause it if we ever have that happen again)


## Tasks Distributed
- Jadi:
  - Work on textbox transfer to gain a better understanding of how sections work and how data is pushed
- Jake:
  - Work on textbox transfer to gain a better understanding of how sections work and how data is pushed
- Pierson:
  - Get more sections working and have the data being sent correctly from them. 
  - Work on fixing the existing code for button editing behavior (maybe)
