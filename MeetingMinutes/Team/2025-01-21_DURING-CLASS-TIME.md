## Topics Discussed
We had not yet started our UI fix that is due tomorrow, so using my laptop, we began the changes by adding an error message "Required" under fields that require input. In our previous state, the web page would not move on, but the user would not know why. We also split up tasks for who will do what over the next 2 days before class.
