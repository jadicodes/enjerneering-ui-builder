# Discovery
### [Meeting Minutes](Minutes.md)

### What was Discussed
The client introduced us to the project, showing us the progress that had already been made by a team of designers already working on the project, which can be seen in [this screenshot from the meeting](discovery_meeting_screenshot_1.jpg).

The tech stack was also covered in the meeting, with the client wanting to use a combination of Next.js, PrismaORM, Postgres, and Supabase as the main tech stack for the project. The client introducing us to Next.js can be seen in [this other screenshot from the meeting](discovery_meeting_screenshot_2.jpg).
