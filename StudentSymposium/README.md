## Jadi's Experience
My experience at the symposium was completely fine. There weren't too many people walking around. Of the people that stopped by our booth, it seemed that many were not very familiar with software development. That's okay, as we got to practice talking about
technology and development using simpler terms. The judges and visitors were very good listeners. There was one man named James that encouraged us to pursue this project commercially, which sadly we cannot do.

## Pierson's Experience
The Symposium was an interesting experience. Being able to share our project with others, but it felt pretty clear that most of the people weren't there for the computer science projects. In a way, it's nice to share our work with people who aren't familiar with programming, but on the other hand, some of the people seemed checked out, which kind of sucked. I think it was a good way to learn to talk about projects without depending on CS jargon, but it was a bit dull and disheartening at points.

## Jake's Experience
I feel like the symposium for computer science students is very rough. This is due to the fact that everything was really focused around research projects while we are building a program. I would love to see something that highlights this within the symposium for students like ourselves. Outside of this, being able to discuss our project was enjoyable as it did give practice to discussing programming and had us thinking about our project in a different light.

## Payton's Experience
I enjoyed my time at the symposium, however it felt very long due to the large gaps inbetween getting to share our project with others. Most people seemed more familiar with research projects and the judges definitely felt uninterested during our pitch. I felt like we got more interest from curious professors rather than the Judges.
