## Jadi's Experience
My experience at the symposium was completely fine. There weren't too many people walking around. Of the people that stopped by our booth, it seemed that many were not very familiar with software development. That's okay, as we got to practice talking about
technology and development using simpler terms. The judges and visitors were very good listeners. There was one man named James that encouraged us to pursue this project commercially, which sadly we cannot do.
