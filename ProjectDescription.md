# Project Description

## Summary

The enJerneering UI Builder is their flagship product aimed at freelance and agency web developers to
speed up the design, development, and deployment of websites, e-commerce storefronts, and
application user interfaces with superior quality and speed metrics. It differs from competitors by targetting freelancers rather than individual consumers. Users design and develop their projects with a familiar drag-and-drop interface to build a web project that will export to
modern front-end tech stacks (Next.js, Svelte, Vue.js, etc..). The user owns the source code, which
can be deployed to common cloud providers (Vercel, Azure, AWS, etc....) and managed via a
centralized web application. Users must be able to wield the power of custom code while feeling like
they are using a traditional DIY website builder like they would with Squarespace.
