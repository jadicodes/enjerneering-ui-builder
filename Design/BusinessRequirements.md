# Business Requirements

## BR1: The platform will allow freelance web designers to create and manage multiple websites through a drag-and-drop interface, which can be exported to Next.js

Freelance web designers often work with multiple clients, and having a user-friendly platform that enables them to quickly create 
and manage websites without extensive coding knowledge is crucial. By implementing a drag-and-drop interface, the platform reduces 
complexity, increases efficiency, and makes web design accessible to a broader audience. This feature is essential for offering a 
competitive product that empowers designers to work faster and more flexibly. Also, Next.js is a widely used JavaScript library for
building user interfaces, and it is known for its flexibility, performance, and scalability. Providing Next.js exporting will allow 
designers to easily deploy their websites or hand them over to development teams.
Since this is the main goal of the program, this is why we believe it is a business requirement.
