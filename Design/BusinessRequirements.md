# Business Requirements

## BR1: The platform will allow freelance web designers to create and manage multiple websites through a drag-and-drop interface.

Freelance web designers often work with multiple clients, and having a user-friendly platform that enables them to quickly create 
and manage websites without extensive coding knowledge is crucial. By implementing a drag-and-drop interface, the platform reduces 
complexity, increases efficiency, and makes web design accessible to a broader audience. This feature is essential for offering a 
competitive product that empowers designers to work faster and more flexibly. Since this is the main goal of the program, this is why 
we believe it is a business requirement.


## BR2: The platform will allow freelance web designers to export and deploy their projects in React.js.

React.js is a widely used JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and it is known for its flexibility, performance, and scalability. 
Providing the ability for designers to export their projects in React.js ensures that they can easily deploy their websites to production or 
hand them over to development teams. This feature is critical as it aligns with modern web development standards, making the platform more 
attractive and relevant to professional web designers who need React.js compatibility. When we asked Jerrod what a successful partnership would 
look like after 6 months, he responded with this as his goal. This is why we believe it is a business requirement.
