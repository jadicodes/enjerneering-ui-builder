# Business Requirements

## BR1: The platform will allow freelance web designers to create and manage multiple websites through a drag-and-drop interface, which can be exported to a web framework of users choice. 


Freelance web designers often work with multiple clients, and having a user-friendly platform that enables them to quickly create and manage websites without extensive coding knowledge is crucial. 
By implementing a drag-and-drop interface, the platform reduces complexity, increases efficiency, and makes web design accessible to a broader audience. This feature is essential for offering a 
competitive product that empowers designers to work faster and more flexibly. Additionally, designers often need to deploy or transfer their websites using different frameworks, as various web 
frameworks—such as React, Vue, Angular, and others—each offer unique capabilities in terms of flexibility, performance, and scalability. By providing an export option to a range of popular frameworks, 
designers can easily adapt their work to suit specific project requirements, ensuring seamless handovers to development teams or facilitating independent deployments.

Since this is the main goal of the program, this is why we believe it is a business requirement.
