# Non-Functional Requirements

## 1. Performance
- **Responsiveness**: The UI and forms must be responsive, with minimal lag when interacting with buttons and submitting forms.
- **Backend Performance**: The Supabase backend should efficiently handle form submissions, project creations, and data retrieval without noticeable delay.
- **Scalability**: The system should be able to scale to handle multiple users and projects simultaneously without performance degradation.

## 2. Reliability
- **Data Integrity**: Ensure that the data submitted through forms is accurately saved in Supabase, and no data is lost or corrupted during transmission or storage.
- **Uptime**: The Supabase backend should provide high availability, ensuring that users can access the system and submit forms without interruptions.
- **Error Handling**: Proper error messages should be shown to the user in case of any issues, and the system should gracefully handle unexpected errors without crashing.

## 3. Security
- **Data Protection**: User data (e.g., project details, workspace settings) must be securely stored in Supabase, with appropriate encryption and security measures in place.
- **Authentication**: qAuth will handle all user authentication processes, ensuring secure login, session management, and access control. Only authenticated users can create or modify projects. qAuth will also ensure password and user information security following best practices.
- **Authorization**: User roles or access permissions should be handled through qAuth to ensure only authorized actions can be performed by specific users.

## 4. Usability
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The drag-and-drop UI and form interactions must be intuitive and easy to use for freelance web designers, minimizing the learning curve.
- **Error Feedback**: Users should receive clear and concise feedback if they enter invalid data or encounter errors during form submission, helping them resolve the issue quickly.

## 5. Maintainability
- **Modular Codebase**: The code for handling form submissions, button interactions, and backend integration should be modular and well-organized, making it easy to maintain and update in future iterations.
- **Testability**: The system should be easy to test for both functional and non-functional requirements, ensuring that future updates donâ€™t break existing functionality.

## 6. Compliance
- **Data Privacy Regulations**: Ensure that user data collection, storage, and authentication via qAuth comply with applicable data privacy laws and regulations, such as GDPR or CCPA, especially if storing user-specific information.

## 7. Extensibility
- **Future-Proofing**: The system design should allow for easy addition of new features, such as support for more project types, additional templates, or integrations with other backend services, without needing major rework.
