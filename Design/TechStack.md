# Tech Stack

Jerrod of enJerneering already has his tech stack laid out. All of the choices he made boil down to getting this service to market as fast as possible.

## [Next.js/Typescript](https://nextjs.org/)
The application is being build with Next.js (full-stack Typescript) with Prisma ORM for persistence. 

Typescript was picked for this project as Javascript is the primary language used for web development. Typescript improves upon Javascript in many ways, namely giving it strict typing. As Jerrod puts it, "it doesn't let you write bad JavaScript." 

## [Prisma ORM](https://www.prisma.io/orm)
Prisma ORM is a good code-first approach to databases and can stay within the same code repository as the frontend, making it a monorepo. Jerrod prefers this workflow, and we agree that it is helpful. 

## [Supabase](https://supabase.com/)
Supabase is database service that can be used to build projects faster. Jerrod defends Supabase by saying that it takes away a lot of the tediousness that other database builders struggle with. 

## [Clerk Authentication](https://clerk.com/)
Jerrod also uses Clerk Auth as a way to avoid manually earning security certifications (which are expensive and time-consuming). Clerk Authenticator saves us development time because we don't have to develop a login service.
