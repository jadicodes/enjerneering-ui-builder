# Tech Stack

Jerrod of enJerneering already has his tech stack laid out.

The application is being build with Next.js (full-stack Typescript) with Prisma ORM for persistence. The deployment infrastructure is Vercel. 
The tool will export to common web frameworks such as Next.js, React, Remix, and Vue. From there, it will deploy to cloud providers such as Azure and AWS.

Typescript was picked for this project as Javascript is the primary language used for web development. Typescript improves upon Javascript in many ways, namely giving it strict typing.
The other tech elements are already chosen by the client and must be abided by.
