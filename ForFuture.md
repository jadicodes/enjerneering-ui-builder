# Known Issues
- Updating Menu Items in Navbar Form sometimes resets Photo (Likely issue in Navbar Form data sending)
- Deleted Layers sometimes remain in BuilderStore and are sent to database on save (unsure of cause)
- Page Name Edits don't automatically update page paths in navbar

# Future Improvements
- Pull previous builder data (layers and pages) from ProjectId when the edit button in workspace is selected
- Improve image saving to minimize file size of sent Data.json
- Fully Build out Service Section using input services in project creation
- Use Uploaded FavIcon within the final web publisher when deploying
- Allow user to update project title and other details
- Add EnJerneering Hosting Publish Option
- More Coloring Options (Ex. Button Colors)
